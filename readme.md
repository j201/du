### The DOM library for coders who don't need a DOM library.

`du` (**D**OM **U**tilities) is a simple, light library that makes common DOM manipulation tasks easy by providing cross-browser helper functions. It operates on native DOM objects and doesn't force you into any major changes from a vanilla JS approach.

`du` is still a work in progress with a very unstable API. Feel free to make comments and recommend changes at this time.

###Background

I started out in web development using vanilla DOM methods. It was useful to learn about things like w3c standards and cross-browser compatibility issues, but it was rather tedious dealing with those and the DOM API's wordiness. After a bit of searching I couldn't find a library I liked that both made using the DOM terse and simple and didn't force entirely new coding styles on me. So I decided to put together some of the utility functions I found useful to make a library that could make web programming quicker and easier without deviating from the way the DOM was meant to be used.

###API

First of all, `du` inherits from `document`, so the functions on `document` can be accessed as properties of `du`. For example, `du.createElement` is a quicker way of accessing `document.createElement`. (Note that modifying these properties will not modify the corresponding `document` properties. Also, IE doesn't like accessing non-function properties like `document.body` from objects other than `document`, so those won't work in IE.)

Note: `el` as a parameter means an HTMLElement.

####Queries

**du.id(id)** - Equivalent to `document.getElementById(id)`  

**du.tag(tag)** - Equivalent to `document.getElementsByTagName(tag)`  
**du.tag(el, tag)** - Equivalent to `el.getElementsByTagName(tag)`

**du.className(className)** - Equivalent to `document.getElementsByClassName(className)`. `className` was used instead of `class` to avoid reserved word errors in IE8  
**du.className(el, className)** - Equivalent to `document.getElementsByClassName(className)`

**du.qa(selector)** - Equivalent to `document.querySelector(selector)`  
**du.qa(el, selector)** - Equivalent to `el.querySelector(selector)`  
**du.qsa(selector)** - Equivalent to `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`  
**du.qsa(el, selector)** - Equivalent to `el.querySelectorAll(selector)`

####Events

**du.event(target, type, listener, [useCapture])** - Equivalent to `target.addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)`. Note that `useCapture` will not do anything on browsers that don't support `addEventListener`  
**du.event(type, listener, [useCapture])** - Equivalent to `window.addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)`  
**du.rmEvent(target, type, listener, [useCapture])** - Equivalent to `target.removeEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)`

**du.load(listener)** - Equivalent to `window.addEventListener("load", listener)`  
**du.ready(listener)** - Equivalent to `window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", listener)` or jQuery's `$(document).ready(listener)`  
**du.click(target, listener)** - Equivalent to `target.addEventListener("click", listener)`

####DOM Mutations

**du.clear(node)** - Removes all of the child nodes of a node  
**du.setChild(node, child)** - Removes all the child nodes of a node and appends `child` to it

**du.prepend(node, child)** - Inserts `child` as the node's first child  
**du.append(node, child)** - Equivalent to `node.appendChild(child)`  
**du.remove(node)** - Removes the given node

**du.textNode(text)** - Equivalent to `document.createTextNode(text)`  
**du.appendText(node, text)** - Appends the given text to `node`  
**du.setText(node, text)** - Removes all child text nodes from a node and appends the given text to it

**du.insertAfter(node, newNode, referenceNode)** - Inserts `newNode` as a child element of `node` after `referenceNode`

####CSS

**du.addClass(el, ...classes)** - Adds the given classes to an element  
**du.rmClass(el, ...classes)** - Removes the given classes from an element

####Utilities

**du.toArray(arrayLike)** - Converts an array-like (e.g., a NodeList) to an array

**du.each(arrayLike, fn)** - Iterates through the elements of an array-like or an array, calling `fn` on each element and returning an array of the results. `fn` is called with the current element, the index, and the array-like as arguments
